Example html syntax :
  <div class="title" data-bind="tab1" >Tab1</div>
  <div id="tab1" class="content">C1</div>

Solution : 
	I used javascript and css for this task.My solution is smilar to bootstrap tab system.
	After page loaded i create click listeners for tabbuttons with class name of 'title'.
	It can be done with onclick method but i try to use as little space as possible in html content.
	Selector(class='title') can be different like 'purpose-of-use="tab"' and it is better but i try to make it simple for this task.
	After click event fires ,function look inside the 'data-bind' attribute(id of content) and use this data(id) to find content.
	When click event fires,function delete 'picked' attribute from all contents and titles.
	And pick(add picked attribute) clicked tab(show content and highlight title in css).

Why i choose this solution :
	I choose this solution because it's easy to implement in html page and css independent(some changes must be made).
	But there is a downside that we can't create multiple tab system using this code.
	I can solve this problem making some changes like adding attribute(for example name) and using this attribute from javascript code for specify different tabs.

****Note : 
(function(){})() or window.onlad ' doesn't work for this problem because when these functions fire content of page is empty and  document.querySelectorAll('.title') can't catch the tabbuttons. 

I get help from 'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/799981/document-ready-equivalent-without-jquery' for this problem.
